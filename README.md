# BTC and the Quantity Theory of Money
Examining how the quantity theory of money applies to the price of Bitcoin


#### We want to explore the basic concept that a crypto currency's price should grow proportionally to the value being transacted on the network according to the [Quantity Theory of Money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantity_theory_of_money). This generally holds true for BTC, with the exception of the speculative bubble in 2015 and 2017.

#### Summary:

* The Quantity Theory of Money relates the value of a currency to the real value of goods and services transacted using that currency.
* If we assume a fixed velocity and average transaction size (in USD), then we can use the quantity theory of money to predict the value of Bitcoin quite accurately, except during the bubble of 2014.
* The price of Bitcoin started to excede the price predicted by the quantity theory of money at the begining of 2017, indicating that the price has been inflated by speculation since early 2017, and could return to a level predicted by transaction volume if the bubble bursts.
